## Time Series with RNN

This case study uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict electricity consumption based on historical data. The "Electricity Consumption'' dataset contains hourly electricity consumption data over a period of time. The aim is to build an RNN model to forecast future electricity consumption, leveraging past consumption patterns.
